Contigo is a project that started out with a question, How can we use modern technology to increase quality of life for people that have to travel alone.

What else do you need?

### The story

Contigo is a project idea born out of the struggles people in Puerto Rico go through for walking alone at night. From this idea,
a great team has been organized for the development and deployment of the idea into a real tool to be used by many.

The idea has gone through a couple of workshops, as well as become part of an organization and development process to evolve and mature. To name them chronologicaly, the idea has gone through the following:
1. Techstars Startup Weekend (with Centro para Emprendedores)
2. NSF I-Corps Customer Discovery Workshop
3. Insituto de Desarrollo para las Comunidades 
4. UPRM Capstone
