subtitle: What is Contigo?
---

Even in this day and age of incredible technological advances, most people fear the simple act of walking around at night. Even more when this walk has to be done alone. Whether it is meeting with friends, or returning home from work, we tend to avoid these walks at all costs. As pedestrians at night we might be creating a perfect scenario for assailants to take advantage of the situation. This fear of becoming part of the statistics becomes exacerbated when there is no one around they can rely on. This might all stem from instinct, but it is also backed up by data. According to the department of justice, most violent crimes on adults peak at 9pm [1]. "CONTIGO" aims to provide a safer environment that allows anyone to feel safe to be anywhere they please. This project will provide a network of quick and easy communication between the people who need help and the ones who can provide it. We want to build a trusted network of people willing to help create safer communities.

One of the main reasons people might feel unsafe is the amount of criminality happening around, but another really important reason is the growing distrust in the policing system. Trust in the policing system has degraded over time due to a multitude of reasons. People have reported waiting hours for police to arrive only for them to not help since the assailant is gone or it might have been too late for the victim. Even when they do arrive on time, there is a large disparity between victims getting their cases picked up and dealt with. Recent events such as George Floydâ€™s case [2], where a police officer took the life of a citizen after pleas from him and the crowd around fell on deaf ears. These kinds of events have caused people to avoid calling the police in case of danger. More specifically, these have caused marginalized communities to feel even more vulnerable. 

Instant communication has never been more accessible to everyday people.  Social media has allowed the world to be more connected than ever.  Many people have taken to popular social media applications like Instagram and Whatsapp to create group chats where they can form communities to rely on each other when they are in need.  However social media platforms have not been designed with these use cases in mind.  We seek to create a platform where people can rely upon in order to feel safe during their times of perceived danger. "CONTIGO" will allow its users to seek help when needed with several features specifically designed to streamline the process that communities go through in order to give each other a hand.   With our service we aim at increasing the chance for people to receive quality help and/or assistance instead of leaving someone helpless during their time of need. 


### The story

Contigo is a project idea born out of the struggles people in Puerto Rico go through for walking alone at night. From this idea,
a great team has been organized for the development and deployment of the idea into a real tool to be used by many.

The idea has gone through a couple of workshops, as well as become part of an organization and development process to evolve and mature. To name them chronologicaly, the idea has gone through the following:
1. Techstars Startup Weekend (with Centro para Emprendedores)
2. NSF I-Corps Customer Discovery Workshop
3. Insituto de Desarrollo para las Comunidades 
4. UPRM Capstone
